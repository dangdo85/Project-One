Game mechanics
    - This is a human vs computer game
    - The players' alternate turns
    - During each turn, the player picks 1 of the 4 randomized cards in hand, and a token is placed on the corresponding space on the board
    - The player then draws a card from the card stack and the turn ends and the other player's turn begins with choosing a card from hand to play
    - TO WIN: a player must complete 1 set of 4 tokens in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally)
